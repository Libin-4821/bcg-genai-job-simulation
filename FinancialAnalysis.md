<h4>Calculating Net profit margin</h4>
<p>Net Profit Margin (also known as “Profit Margin” or “Net Profit Margin Ratio”) is a financial ratio used to calculate the percentage of profit a company produces from its total revenue. It measures the amount of net profit a company obtains per dollar of revenue gained. The net profit margin is equal to net profit (also known as net income) divided by total revenue, expressed as a percentage.</p>

`sorted_data['Net Profit Margin (%)'] = sorted_data['Net Income'] / sorted_data['Total Revenue'] * 100`

<h4>Calculating Return On Assets</h4>
<p>The return on assets ratio is commonly expressed as a percentage using a company’s net income and average assets. A higher ROA means a company is more efficient and productive at managing its balance sheet to generate profits. A lower ROA indicates there's room for improvement.</p>
<br>
<p>ROA for public companies can vary substantially and are highly dependent on the industry in which they function. The ROA for a tech company won’t necessarily correspond to that of a food and beverage company. It's best to compare a company's ROA against its previous ROA numbers or a similar company’s ROA when using it as a comparative measure.</p>

`sorted_data['Return On Assets (%)'] = sorted_data['Net Income'] / sorted_data['Total Assets'] * 100`

<h4>Calculating Asset Turnover Ratio</h4>
<p>The asset turnover ratio is a measurement that shows how efficiently a company is using its owned resources to generate revenue or sales. The ratio compares the company's gross revenue to the average total number of assets to reveal how many sales were generated from every dollar of company assets. The higher the asset ratio, the more efficient the use of the company's assets.</p>

`sorted_data['Asset Turnover Ratio (%)'] = sorted_data['Total Revenue'] / sorted_data['Total Assets'] * 100`

<h4>Calculating Shareholders' equity</h4>
<p>Shareholders’ equity is the shareholders’ claim on assets after all debts owed are paid up.
It is calculated by taking the total assets minus total liabilities.
Shareholders’ equity determines the returns generated by a business compared to the total amount invested in the company.</p>

`sorted_data['Shareholders\' Equity'] = sorted_data['Total Assets'] - sorted_data['Total Liabilities']`

<h4>Calculating Debt to Equity ratio</h4>
<p>The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio is used to evaluate a company’s financial leverage and is calculated by dividing a company’s total liabilities by its shareholder equity. The D/E ratio is an important metric in corporate finance. It is a measure of the degree to which a company is financing its operations with debt rather than its own resources.</p>

`sorted_data['Debt to Equity Ratio (%)'] = sorted_data['Total Liabilities'] / sorted_data['Shareholders\' Equity'] * 100`

<h4>Calculating Debt to Asset Ratio</h4>
<p>The debt-to-asset ratio is a financial metric that measures the percentage of a company's assets that are financed by debt. It's calculated by dividing a company's total debt by its total assets. 
How to calculate the debt-to-asset ratio </p>
<ul>Find the total debt and total assets of the company from its balance sheet</ul>
<ul>Divide the total debt by the total assets</ul>

`sorted_data['Debt to Asset Ratio (%)'] = sorted_data['Total Liabilities'] / sorted_data['Total Assets'] * 100`
